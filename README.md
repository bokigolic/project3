![Github licence](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

Hiking App allows the user to create their own Hiking Route.
User can do CRUD functions with his own Hike. Other Users can view other users hikes.
For future we would like to add functions like comment, ratings, users can join other hikes...
